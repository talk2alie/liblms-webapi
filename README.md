# Liberian Schools Learning Management System - Web API

## Introduction

Liberia is a small country of about 4 million peple. Like most countries in our region, we have faced struggles, ranging from a 14-year civil war that devastated almost all of our infrastructure, to the Ebola crisis that destroyed our remaining infrastructure.

Education, being one of the biggest losers in these crisis, needs a revival from the crippling isssues like sexual harrassment, high dropout rate, teacher/student absenteeism, bribery and many more that keeps dragging it down. 

Our response is to build a Learning Management System that tackles the issues that technology can solve. This repository holds code for one part of the overall system. The system is made of four repositories: **Web API (C#, ASP.Net Core, EF Core)**, Web (Angular), Mobile (Android), and Desktop (C#/WPF).

You can work on issues for each repository as you see fit.
